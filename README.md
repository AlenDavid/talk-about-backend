## Quick Start

### Golang

For testing and developing, please follow golang's install documentation: https://go.dev/doc/install

### Tilt

For running all applications, please install tilt https://docs.tilt.dev/. To run tilt, you will need a local kubernetes cluster. Our recommendation: either [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).
