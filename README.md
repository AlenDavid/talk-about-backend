This repository is a heads-up example of my experience building golang backend projects.

- [Talk: Backend (on golang)](#talk-backend-on-golang)
  - [Quick Start](#quick-start)
    - [Golang](#golang)
    - [Tilt](#tilt)

## Quick Start

### Golang

For testing and developing, please follow golang's install documentation: https://go.dev/doc/install

### Tilt

For running all applications, please install tilt https://docs.tilt.dev/. To run tilt, you will need a local kubernetes cluster. Our recommendation: either [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).
